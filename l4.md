title: Using Sanction with Laravel 4
layout: default
---

Sanction and Laravel 4 are the best of friends! Add the following to your `app/config/app.php` file, at the end of the `$providers` array:

```php
'Curlymoustache\Sanction\SanctionServiceProvider'
```

Then add the following alias to the `$aliases` array:

```php
'Sanction' => 'Curlymoustache\Sanction\SanctionFacade',
```

This will make calls to `Sanction::methodName()` possible.

#### Publish the config files

*Now **publish the config files**, this is needed*:

```
php artisan config:publish curlymoustache/sanction
```

You should now be able to open `app/config/packages/curlymoustache/sanction/roles.php` and `app/config/packages/curlymoustache/sanction/config.php`.

There! Now you can add your role definitions into the `roles.php` config file.

#### Run the migration

Run the migration from the package, this will install a `roles` table into your database, allowing you to persist role information for users.

Simply run:

```
$ php artisan migrate --package="curlymoustache/sanction"
```

#### Eloquent Extension

<div class="alert alert-warning">Note: Sanction Requires PHP5.4+ if you're using it with any of the included `Traits`.</div>

Are you using the default `Eloquent` user model? Good news then! There's a PHP Trait that you can include into your `User` model to enable some shortcuts.

Just `use` the trait in your User model:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Auth\UserInterface;
use Illuminate\Auth\Reminders\RemindableInterface;

class User extends Eloquent implements UserInterface, RemindableInterface {

    use Curlymoustache\Sanction\Extensions\EloquentExtension;

...
```

This will allow to use the following methods:

<table>
<tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th>
<tr>
    <td>
    <code>User::usersWithRole($role_name)</code></td><td>Return an eloquent collection of users with a particular role.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><code>$user->addRole($role_name)</code></td><td>Add a role to the current instance of `User`</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>$user->deleteRole($role_name)</code></td><td>Delete a role from the current instance of `User`.</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>$user->can($permission_names)</code></td><td>Verify a user has a permission (string) or multiple permissions (array).</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>$user->is($role_name)</code></td><td>Returns true if the user has the role supplied.</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>$user->getRoles()</code></td><td>Returns the list of roles associated with the user, if any.</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>$user->getPermissions()</code></td><td>Returns the list of permissions associated with the user, if any.</td></tr>

</table>

>Remember that to use this extension, your model *must* extend the `Eloquent` class, and be using `id` as the primary key.

#### Clear the permissions cache with Artisan

When you update `app/config/packages/curlymoustache/sanction/roles.php` with caching enabled in the config file, you will need to clear the permissions cache for your new rules to take effect.

Sanction provides a handy artisan command to do so, this will call the `delete` method on whatever `cache_provider` you have setup in config.php.


```
$ php artisan sanction:cleanup
```
